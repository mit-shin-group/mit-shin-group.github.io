Further, he applied bilevel optimization to model market interactions during the transition to net-zero energy systems. David contributed to the Horizon 2020 project DMX™ Demonstration in Dunkirk (3D) by performing life-cycle assessments for full-scale CCUS supply chains. He also worked on the Swiss demonstration project DemoUpCARMA, focusing on carbon dioxide transportation. David earned his M.S. in Energy Engineering at RWTH Aachen University in 2018 with a thesis on the operational optimization of industrial energy systems and his B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at RWTH Aachen University in 2016.

He received his Ph.D. in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from Yonsei University (advised by Prof. Il Moon) and received his B.Sc. in Chemical Engineering from Sungkyunkwan University.

                <p>Yurim focuses on formulating and solving mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problems to support operating decisions in hydrogen production systems under uncertainty. Her research project aims to develop cost-effective and low-carbon hydrogen production strategies that are adaptable to various system conditions.
