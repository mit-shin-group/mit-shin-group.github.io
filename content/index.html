<h2>Group Overview</h2> 
<p>
  Our research group is dedicated to tackling the mathematical, computational, and practical challenges involved in making systematic decisions in complex systems. We strive to make contributions in the fields of { mathematical optimization }, { control theory }, { machine learning }, { process systems engineering }, and { energy systems }.
</p>
<p>
  Here are some of our specific research interests:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Developing scalable algorithms capable of addressing challenging { decision-making problems } in various engineering and society domains.
    </li>
    <li>
      Advancing our understanding and developing algorithms for { machine learning } methods in { control } problems. 
    </li>
    <li> 
      Building computational infrastructure for scalable and data-driven decision-making by harnessing the capabilities of modern  { high-performance computing }, particularly through the use of { GPU computing }.
    </li>
    <li>
      Making tangible impacts in decision-making practices within the domains of { process systems engineering } and { energy systems } by introducing new modeling paradigms, algorithms, and software tools. 
    </li>
  </ul>

<h2>PSE Seminar Series</h2>
<p>
  <a href="">Shin group</a> and <a href="https://web.mit.edu/braatzgroup/">Braatz group</a> are co-hosting the <a href="https://pse-seminar.mit.edu">MIT Process Systems Engineering Seminar Series</a>. This seminar series features talks by leading researchers in the field of process systems engineering, covering a wide range of topics such as process control, process design, optimization, machine learning, data analytics, and their applications in diverse areas. Open to the public, the seminar series offers a great opportunity to learn about the latest research in process systems engineering. You can receive seminar information by subscribing to our <a href="https://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/pse-seminar">mailing list</a>. We hope to see you at the next seminar!
