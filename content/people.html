	<h3>Flemming Holtorf</h3>
	<p><a href="mailto:holtorf@mit.edu">holtorf@mit.edu</a></p>
	<p>
		Flemming is a postdoctoral associate in the Shin group working on advanced decision-support tools for the operation of battery systems. Flemming’s research interest lies in control and optimization theory, applied statistics, as well as stochastic processes and modeling. A core theme of his work is to leverage theory to devise numerical methods and build computational tools to support decision-making under uncertainty and at scale. His research has found applications in domains as diverse as quantum information science, space weather forecasting, stochastic chemical modeling, and now predominantly energy and process systems engineering. 
		Prior to joining the Shin group, Flemming received a PhD from MIT (advisor: Alan Edelman, MIT Math/CSAIL), an MS degree from RWTH Aachen University (advisors: Alexander Mitsos, RWTH MechE and Lorenz Biegler, CMU ChemE), and a BS degree from RWTH, where he also served as an undergraduate researcher (advisor: Alexander Mitsos, RWTH MechE). His MS thesis research conducted as a visiting researcher in the Biegler group at Carnegie Mellon University was awarded the Friedrich-Wilhelm Prize.

		<p>
			David is a graduate student focused on designing GPU solvers for nonlinear optimization and using learning techniques to improve these optimizations. His broader research interest is in accelerating calculations using specific algorithms tailored for particular hardware, such as GPUs. He is particularly interested in sum-of-squares programming and semidefinite programming, with applications in robotics. David holds a B.S. in Information and Data Science from Caltech and a B.A. in Physics from Grinnell College. In his spare time, he enjoys playing percussion in both a symphony orchestra and a wind ensemble.
