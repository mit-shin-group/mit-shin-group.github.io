    <h2>Learning for Control</h2>
    <p>
			In a wide range of applications, the control system must operate within uncertain and dynamic environments, often with only partial observation of the system. Maintaining stability, robustness, and high operational performance under such conditions presents a formidable challenge, necessitating the study of data-driven control methods.

    <h2>High-Performance Computing</h2>
    <p>
			State-of-the-art numerical software tools have made significant progress in solving optimization problems at a moderately large scale.

			Specifically, we focus on the following areas:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Development of a comprehensive nonlinear optimization framework that can fully exploit the capabilities of DOE's leadership-class supercomputers like { Aurora }, { Summit }, and { Frontier }. These frameworks will incorporate general-purpose algebraic modeling systems, domain-specific modeling tools, automatic differentiation frameworks, numerical linear solvers, and numerical optimization solvers.
				<li>
					Building computational infrastructure for optimization with neural-network surrogate models that interface the machine learning frameworks with nonlinear programming solvers.

    <h2>Energy Systems</h2>
    <p>
			Society is confronting the unprecedented challenge of decarbonizing energy systems to mitigate climate change. To decarbonize the U.S. energy systems by 2050, we will need to produce at least 40% of the nation's total energy demand from wind and solar, which is far higher than the current 12%.
