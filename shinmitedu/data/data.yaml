David’s work spans environmental life-cycle assessment, process optimization, and sustainable system design, with applications in carbon capture and storage technologies and the broader energy transition. During his doctoral studies at ETH Zurich (advisor: André Bardow, Department of Mechanical and Process Engineering), David studied the design and operation of net-zero energy systems employing multi-criterial optimization to evaluate trade-offs between economic and environmental objectives. Further, he applied bilevel optimization to model market interactions during the transition to net-zero energy systems. David contributed to the Horizon 2020 project DMX™ Demonstration in Dunkirk (3D) by performing life-cycle assessments for full-scale CCUS supply chains. He also worked on the Swiss demonstration project DemoUpCARMA, focusing on carbon dioxide transportation. David earned his M.S. in Energy Engineering at RWTH Aachen University in 2018 with a thesis on the operational optimization of industrial energy systems and his B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at RWTH Aachen University in 2016.
