<h1>Software</h1>
<p>
  Our research group is committed to developing, contributing to, and maintaining open-source software for scientific computing. In particular, we are highly dedicated to making contributions to packages within the { Julia Language } ecosystem, which serves as an excellent platform for implementing efficient numerical software. We are interested in a wide range of topics, including { numerical optimization }, { numerical linear algebra }, { automatic differentiation }, { algebraic modeling platforms }, and modeling tools for chemical and biological processes and energy systems. On this page, you will find a list of open-source development projects led by our research group.

  { MadNLP } is a <a
		    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_programming">nonlinear
    programming</a> solver based on the filter line-search <a
							     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior-point_method">interior
    point method</a> (as in <a
			      href="https://github.com/coin-or/Ipopt">Ipopt</a>) that can
  handle/exploit diverse classes of data structures, either on <a
								 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">host</a>
  or <a
       href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit">device</a>
  memories. MadNLP shines when the solution of the problem can benefit from GPU acceleration or when the problem possesses a structure that can be exploited. The capabilities of MadNLP have been showcased for various energy infrastructure problems (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16830">static optimal power flow</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04869">stochastic optimal power flow</a>) as well as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13049">model predictive control problems</a>.

<p>
  { ExaModels } is an algebraic modeling and automatic differentiation tool in Julia Language, specialized for { single instruction, multiple data } (SIMD) abstraction of { nonlinear programs } (NLPs). SIMD abstraction allows for the preservation of the parallelizable structure within the model equations, facilitating efficient, parallel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation" rel="nofollow">reverse-mode automatic differentiation</a> on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit" rel="nofollow">GPU</a> accelerators. The capabilities of ExaModels have been showcased in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16830">our paper</a> and achieve significant speedup via the use of GPUs.
